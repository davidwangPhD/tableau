# tableau
tableau protfolio project

this project uses a mysql file named db_dump.sql which you can find in this git repository imprt the file in to a data base hosed in google gcp google sql using mysql engine and then use tableau to do visualisation on the sql
base.

then we used opened a google virtual machine connecting via chrome remote desktop where we set up our mysql workbench there since for handling sensitive data desktop enviroment is not safe so we use cloud remote desktop when possible.

then I did some experation of the data via the sql commands.

the I install the tableau desktop and started to do some data visualisation and analysis work there

I linked the five different tables together to a central main table via keywold joins creating a star schema.

the I did some visualisation on the data base. 

the I publish the data base to tablueau online but I soon find out tableau online is very expensive 70 USD a month so I output my results in to pdf as to save cost.

the original interactive tableau tables are nice and interactive but pdf is static so I published a few different pdf in differnt date choices. the following are pdfs the sizing is a bit off because of the conversion process but the original tableau looks perfectly fine it is just the conversion.
